# CPE 322 Lab 1

For Lab 1, the objective was to run some GHDL examples in a GHDL simulator or runtime of some sorts. I chose to run the VHDL/GHDL samples in Vivado, because as of 3/31/2024, I am enrolled in CPE 487 (Digital System Design) and
we need to use Vivado a lot in the course to run VHDL code so it was convenient to use it to run the samples.

The first example I ran was the half adder GHDL example. Per the simulation results, inputs of 1 and 1 into inputs a and b respectively return a sum of 0 with a carry of 1, as a half adder ideally should work.

The second example I ran was the 4 to 1 multiplexer GHDL example. The simulation results from running the test bench show that the result is what is expected from a 4 to 1 multiplexer.

Simulation results are below.
